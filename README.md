# Impact Categories

**VEP** <br>
- HIGH (H): The variant is assumed to have high (disruptive) impact in the protein, probably causing protein truncation, loss of function, or triggering nonsense mediated decay<br>
- MODERATE (M): A non-disruptive variant that might change protein effectiveness<br>
- LOW (L): Assumed to be mostly harmless or unlikely to change protein behavior<br>
- MODIFIER (MO): Usually non-coding variants or variants affecting non-coding genes, where predictions are difficult or there is no evidence of impact<br><br>
**PolyPhen** <br>
- probably damaging (PR): It is with high confidence supposed to affect protein function or structure<br>
- possibly damaging (PO): It is supposed to affect protein function or structure<br>
- benign (BE): Most likely lacking any phenotypic effect<br>
- unknown (UN): When in some rare cases, the lack of data does not allow PolyPhen to make a prediction<br><br>
**SIFT** <br>
- tolerated: Not likely to have a phenotypic effect<br>
- tolerated_low_confidence: More likely to have a phenotypic effect than 'tolerated'<br>
- deleterious: Likely to have a phenotypic effect<br>
- deleterious_low_confidence: Less likely to have a phenotypic effect than 'deleterious'<br>
